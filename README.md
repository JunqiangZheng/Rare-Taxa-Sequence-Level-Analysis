# Rare-Taxa-Sequence-Level-Analysis

RTSeqLA (Rare Taxa Sequence Level Analysis) aims to compare the ability of discrimination rare sequences and erroneous sequences of denoising pipelines: DaDa2, Deblur, and UNOISE3. 
It contained 4 steps: (1) Defining the rare taxa, (2) Trimming representative sequences, (3) Matching sequences from the reference database, (4) Calculating the hamming distance between representative sequence and database sequence.

# Instructions

1. Ensure all files in the same working directory.

2. Cope the feature tables, representative sequences and taxonomy tables, generated by pipelines into the working directory.

3. Open the R script "0. Manual - Rare Taxa Sequence Level Analysis (RTSeqLA).R" and follw the annotation in the script.
